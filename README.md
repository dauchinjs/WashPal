I think that both approaches are secure, but the second type would be more secure, because to get information I used

To make it more secure I could put the authentication information in the .env file, and use the dotenv package to get
the information from the .env file.

2.Why are all time values in UTC?

Also known as Coordinated Universal Time, UTC is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks

deal with multiple time zones and for users it is easier to understand.
